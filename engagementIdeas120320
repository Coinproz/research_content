  could eventually be collated into a digest or ebook
  
 Interviewing research writers about their work
  rationale: creates user-friendly content that would allow others to chime in
 
 Creating intermediate content that non-experts would be interested in
  whitepapers: state of the blockchain 2021; threat assessement - biggest financial worries;
  everything you've always wanted to know but were afraid to ask about liquidity

  longterm it would build relationships with major universities / institutions
